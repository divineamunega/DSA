/**
 * This question was easy.... I was just overthinking
 * The first time I tried to use nested loops to solve it (It works but it wasn't effecient at all ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ )
 *
 * Ok good then I tried another method... Which I've deleted cause it did'nt work for a lot of edge cases.
 * This last method was given to me by CHATgpt (That's right I'm a 1x dev ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­) but I understand it.. Amazingly
 *
 * It's simple and I think I should have thought of it.
 * We initialize minPRice as infinity (Cause that's the biggest a number can get ðŸŒšðŸŒš) then update it as we move through the array
 * At the end of the loop our minPrice will be the smallest number.. (Makes sense right)
 * Then during the loops we will simulteanously calculate the profits... We calculate the  profits by subtracting the current price from the minimum price
 * Then we update maxProfit if we get a bigger profit than it.
 *
 * Time complexity 0n
 * space complexity 01
 *
 * where n is the number of elements in the array
